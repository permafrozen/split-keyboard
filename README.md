## About

This repository contains all information I *learned* while building the **[Temper](https://github.com/raeedcho/temper)** split-keyboard. It also includes all code and models I *created/tweaked* in the process, to archive the whole learning experience.

## Motivation

Ergonomic split-keyboards have multiple concise *advantages* to regular conventional keyboards. They *reduce ulnar deviation* and help to keep one's wrists straight and shoulders relaxed, which can help to *prevent carpal tunnel syndrome*. You can also adjust the angle of the halves to suit your writing posture and leads to *greater comfort* while writing.
